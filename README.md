## Yaya - Yet Another Yet Another

Yaya is "Yet another Yet Another". There are already so many Yet Anothers out there, but I felt the need to make my own implementation for three main reasons:

1. Other Yet Anothers don't provide the exact functionality that I need
2. The codebases of most Yet Anothers are messy
3. Yet Anothers are often slow and bloated

Yaya does not have these problems. It requires no dependencies, is super fast, has a simple and well-written codebase and is extremely extensible via shell scripting. 

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/davidabernado/yaya
cd yaya/src
bash yaya.sh
```

Enjoy a simple, fast, secure Yet Another!
